    "# Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC)\n",
    "\n",
    "[SMPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation) is the backbone of encrypted, federated deep-learning. SMPC is exactly the way it sounds; it makes use of multiple workers - remote parties in a network - as well as a trusted third party worker that provides the encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "SMPC protects the privacy of data held by each partyin the network from all the other workers, while maintaing the ability to securely evaluate a global function F across the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "SMPC works without keys like the ones used for SSH that you may be familiar with. Encrytion keys are not necessay since values are split into *shares* which are distributed amongst the workers. Therefore, in order to decrypt a value all of the workers must agree to put it back together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I will dive into the basics of SMPC, but for a more thorough tutorial, please visit [Morten Dahl's fantastic tutorial on SMPC](https://mortendahl.github.io/2017/04/17/private-deep-learning-with-mpc/)\n",

For now, we will pretend that Q is a small numer `Q = 10` for the purpose of this example. We will also be splitting each value into three shares, as if there were three workers/members in our network."

    "We want to aggregate numbers while numbers are encrypted so that no individual entity will see what the encrypted number actually is.\n",

    "\n",
    "One thing to note is that without an extra step, we actually leak some information. For example, if `share_a=2` and we know we only have positive integers, then `decrypted_x > 2`. To fix this potential information leakage, we use very large number Q. This now gives us an infinite number of possibilites for `share_a` and `share_b`, that could map to the correct output value."
